            <h1>Our Happy Story</h1>
        </div>
        <p>
            The Cornfield Cacti story begins in the sleepy town of Ames, Iowa. Or Johnston, Iowa, depending on who you
            ask.
            Pradyumn, Will, Cole, and Cameron met in their youth (since passed) through Johnston public schools. The four all
            ended
            up at Iowa State for their education. They formed the zygote of Cornfield Cacti soon after. Sam met Cameron
            and Pradyumn through
            their mutual employment at the school's IT call center. The boys (barring Cole) met up at Will's for their
            first practice. Cole came in some months later to bless us with low end.

                Will asked to not have a bio to, "maintain the element of mystery". He's getting this.
