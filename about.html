            <h1>Our Happy Story</h1>
        </div>
        <p>
            The Cornfield Cacti story begins in the sleepy town of Ames, Iowa. Or Johnston, Iowa, depending on who you ask.
            Pradyumn, Will, and Cameron met in their youth (since passed) through Johnston public schools. The three all ended 
            up at Iowa State for their education. They formed the zygote of Cornfield Cacti soon after. Sam met Cameron through
            their mutual employment at the school's IT call center. Cameron found out that Sam had recently started playing drums,
            and forced him to join his band. Sam was too polite to refuse. Sam found a flyer from a bassist looking for a band 
            on a bulletin board after taking a final exam. This bassist was Finn. The boys met up at Will's for their first practice.
