            <h1>Our Happy Story</h1>
        </div>
        <p>
            The Cornfield Cacti story begins in the sleepy town of Ames, Iowa. Or Johnston, Iowa, depending on who you
            ask.
            Pradyumn, Will, and Cameron met in their youth (since passed) through Johnston public schools. The three all
            ended
            up at Iowa State for their education. They formed the zygote of Cornfield Cacti soon after. Sam met Cameron
            and Pradyumn through
            their mutual employment at the school's IT call center. Cameron found out that Sam had recently started
            playing drums,
            and forced him to join his band. Sam was too polite to refuse. The boys met up at Will's for their
            first practice.

                Will asked to not have a bio to, "maintain the element of mystery". He's getting this.

                Sam plays drums and produces. I also made the website,
                not for nothing.
